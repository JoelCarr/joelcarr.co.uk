I have been prototyping and adding modules for the Dare site along with the rest of the team in our downtime. With our updated Git workflow and automated deployment system, it became really easy for our team to make quick changes / build a new module for the site.

Recently Dare has had a rebrand which required changes to the site. Thankfully, with the use of SASS variables we were able to update the colour scheme in no time. For the rebrand I also got to work on the video / image carousel.
