Last year in spring, Barclays released a new initiative called Life Skills. Barclays wanted to help teenagers gain vital skills in a variety of areas such as investing, education, and careers. I was the tech lead for the interactive <a href="https://www.barclayslifeskills.com/key-skills/getting-to-know-yourself/wheel-of-strengths/" target="_blank">modules</a> that taught users the skills they needed. Each module needed to be visually impressive as the subject matter for the audience is not taken lightly. This allowed myself to play with CSS3 animations and Canvas.

We decided the second lot of modules should be streamlined with each other. We built a backbone application to set standard shared rules for each module which could be extended for the individual interactions required.
