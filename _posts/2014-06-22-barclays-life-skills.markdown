Barclays Life Skills helps teenagers gain vital skills in a variety of areas such as money skills, education, and careers. I was the tech lead for the interactive <a href="https://www.barclayslifeskills.com/key-skills/getting-to-know-yourself/wheel-of-strengths/" target="_blank">modules</a> illustrated and enlivened the lesson. To lighten up the lessons, the modules were highly interactive and visually impressive. I found it particularly fun and rewarding to work with CSS3 animations and Canvas for these modules.
