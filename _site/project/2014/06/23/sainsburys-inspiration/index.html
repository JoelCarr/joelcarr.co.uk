        <p>Sainsbury’s wanted a new content-driven site for the countdown to Christmas Day with featured daily homepages showing recipes, articles, and video content. I was responsible for the Wordpress back-end and the responsive front-end.</p>

<p>After Christmas, Sainsbury’s loved the site so much that they have decided to keep it for another two years. Because we had developed our team’s Git workflow, that worked with Jenkins for automated deployments between environments, it was easy to work on multiple versions of the site simultaneously.</p>
