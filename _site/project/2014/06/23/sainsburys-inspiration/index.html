        <p>Sainsbury’s wanted a new content driven site for the countdown to Christmas day with featured daily homepages showing recipes, articles, and video content. I was responsible for Wordpress backend and the responsive frontend.</p>

<p>After Christmas, Sainsbury’s loved the site so much that they have decided to keep it for another two years. Fortunately we had anticipated this, we developed our team’s Git workflow that worked with Jenkins for automated deployments between environments for our releases.</p>
