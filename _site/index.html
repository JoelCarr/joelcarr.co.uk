                <p>I am a front-end developer at creative advertising agency <a href="//thisisdare.com/" class="dare" target="_blank">Dare</a> based in central London. Although I focus in front-end development, I dabble with any technologies I can get my hands on. I have worked on all kinds of projects such as large-scale websites, phonegap applications, and iAds to name a few.</p>

                <p>When I am trying to learn new things, I have started to put them onto my <a href="http://www.github.com/joelcarr" class="github" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I also ramble about my experiments and food on <a href="http://twitter.com/joelcarr" class="twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> as well. If you would like to get in touch with me directly, send me an <a href="mailto:joel.ben.carr@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>. You could also have a look at my professional experience on my <a href="/joelcarr-cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=78407873" class="linkedin" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                    <p>Sainsbury’s wanted a new content-driven site for the countdown to Christmas Day with featured daily homepages showing recipes, articles, and video content. I was responsible for the Wordpress back-end and the responsive front-end.</p>

<p>After Christmas, Sainsbury’s loved the site so much that they have decided to keep it for another two years. Because we had developed our team’s Git workflow, that worked with Jenkins for automated deployments between environments, it was easy to work on multiple versions of the site simultaneously.</p>

I was the tech lead for the interactive <a href="https://www.barclayslifeskills.com/key-skills/getting-to-know-yourself/wheel-of-strengths/" target="_blank">modules</a> illustrated and enlivened the lesson. To lighten up the lessons, the modules were highly interactive and visually impressive. I found it particularly fun and rewarding to work with CSS3 animations and Canvas for these modules.</p>
